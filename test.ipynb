Similarly, fisheries and aquaculture also represent critical livelihoods, representing about 40 percent of total export earnings.\n"

    "Mozambique has a tropical to sub-tropical climate and experiences two seasons: a cool and dry season from April to September and a hot and humid season between October and March.\\\n",

    "**TEMPERATURE**: Average annual temperatures in warmer regions of Mozambique range from 20 to 27°C, and in cooler regions average annual temperatures range from 15 to 25°C. Average annual temperature has increased by 0.6°C between 1960 and 2006. Mean annual temperatures are projected to increase by 1.0-2.8°C by the 2060s and by 1.4-4.6°C by the 2090s compared to 1970-1999 average observed temperatures. These increases are projected to be more rapid in the inland regions than on the coast. The frequency of hot days and nights are projected to increase while the frequency of cold days and nights will decrease.\n",

    "**PRECIPITATION**: The wet season in Mozambique lasts from November to April, bringing around 150 to 300 mm of rainfall per month in the north and 50 to 150 mm per month in the south. Average annual rainfall has decreased by 2.5 mm per month per decade between 1960 and 2006. However, the intensity of heavy rainfall events has increased over the same period, with the largest increases during the wet season. Rainfall projections are varied and divergent across models, particularly depending on season and region. The models indicate an overall increase in precipitation, especially during the wet season and in coastal regions."
